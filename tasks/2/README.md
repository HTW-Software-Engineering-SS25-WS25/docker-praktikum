# Task 2

## Working with Docker

### Examples

1. Look into the examples provided in the `examples` directory. These examples demonstrate how to use Docker for various tasks, such as running a Backend with Python, or a Web Frontend with Vuejs.

2. Get to know to the examples and try to run them on your local machine. Start by running the examples locally without Docker and familiarize yourself with the code. Then, try to run them using Docker. (Do not use docker-compose just yet.)

3. Now that your familiar with the examples, try to modify them. For instance, you can change the port on which the application runs, or add a new feature to the application. Make sure to test your changes both locally and in Docker.
