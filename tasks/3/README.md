## Working with Registries

Since your examples are now running in Docker, you can push them to a Docker registry. This allows you to share your images with others or deploy them to a production environment.

In the Tutorial you already learned how to push images to Docker Hub. 

1. Try to push your images either to docker Hub or to a private registry. You can use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) for this purpose.

2. Once you have pushed your images, try to pull them from the registry on a different machine or environment. This will help you understand how to work with Docker images in a distributed environment. Feel free to ask your fellow students to pull your images and run them on their machines and check if they work as expected.
